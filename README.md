# Microsoft Graph API Plugins for TypeSpec

A TypeSpec library that provides pre-built Microsoft Graph API plugins for Microsoft 365 Copilot and other applications. This library includes ready-to-use API definitions for common Microsoft Graph operations like email management and task handling.

## Features

- ðŸ“§ **Mail Operations**: Send emails through Microsoft Graph API
- âœ… **Task Management**: Manage To-Do tasks and task lists
- ðŸ”§ **TypeSpec Integration**: Built with TypeSpec for type-safe API definitions
- ðŸ¤– **Copilot Ready**: Designed for Microsoft 365 Copilot integration
- ðŸ“Š **Adaptive Cards**: Includes pre-built adaptive card templates

## Installation

```bash
npm install m365-copilot-api-plugins-graph
```

## Peer Dependencies

Make sure you have the following TypeSpec packages installed:

```bash
npm install @typespec/http @typespec/openapi @typespec/openapi3
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

Import the library in your TypeSpec project:

```typespec
import "m365-copilot-api-plugins-graph";
```

### Available Operations

#### Mail Operations

- **Send Email**: Send emails using the Microsoft Graph API with support for:
  - HTML and text content
  - Multiple recipients (To, CC)
  - Custom subjects and body content
  - Automatic saving to Sent Items

#### Task Operations

- **Get Tasks**: Fetch tasks from specific task lists
- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks to task lists
- **Update Tasks**: Modify existing tasks
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from task lists

### Authentication

This library uses Microsoft Graph API authentication. Make sure your application has the appropriate permissions:

#### Required Scopes for Mail

- `Mail.Send` - Send emails on behalf of the user
- `Mail.ReadWrite` - Read and write access to user mailboxes

#### Required Scopes for Tasks

- `Tasks.ReadWrite` - Read and write access to user tasks

### Example Usage

The library provides TypeSpec definitions that can be compiled to OpenAPI specifications for use in various applications, including Microsoft 365 Copilot plugins.

#### Sending an Email

```json
{
  "message": {
    "subject": "Hello from TypeSpec!",
    "body": {
      "contentType": "html",
      "content": "<h1>Hello World</h1>"
    },
    "toRecipients": [
      {

      }
    ]
  },
  "saveToSentItems": true
}
```
